        <p> By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession 
            in the West, partly due to the process of labor specialization that 
            occurred there and partly due to the new technologies and business 
            possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New 
            production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication 
            medium (such as a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, 
            throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, 
            book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all 
            visual elements of communication and integrated them into a harmonious 
            whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, 
            typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to 
            identify the emerging field.[11]
