                    Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers 
                    use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a 
                    surface breathing gas supply, and therefore has a limited but 
                    variable endurance.[1] The name scuba is an anacronym for 
                    "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus" and was coined 
                    by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. 
                    Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually 
                    compressed air,[2] affording them greater independence and 
                    movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater 
                    than free divers.[1] Although the use of compressed air is common, 
                    a gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched 
                    air or nitrox, has become popular due to the reduced nitrogen 
                    intake during long or repetitive dives. Also, breathing gas 
                    diluted with helium may be used to reduce the effects of nitrogen 
                    narcosis during deeper dives.

                <p>
                    Scuba diving equipment, also known as scuba gear, is the 
                    equipment used by a scuba diver for the purpose of diving, 
                    and includes the breathing apparatus, diving suit, buoyancy 
                    control and weighting systems, fins for mobility, mask for 
                    improving underwater vision, and a variety of safety equipment 
                    and other accessories.
                </p>

                    The defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous 
                    scuba, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which 
                    allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported 
                    by the diver. It is also commonly referred to as the scuba set.
                    As one descends, in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure 
                    at the surface,the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure 
                    of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 
                    10 m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must 
                    balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow controlled 
                    inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe 
                    air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below 3 feet 
                    (0.9 m) under the water.[2] Most recreational scuba diving 
                    is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and 
                    nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the 
                    demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a mouthpiece becomes 
                    second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a 
                    full-face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often 
                    allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba 
                    divers are more likely to use full-face masks, which protect the 
                    diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.[43]

                    <h3 id="procedures">Procedures</h3>
                    The underwater environment is unfamiliar and hazardous, and 
                    to ensure diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must 
                    be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail 
                    and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and 
                    survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and 
                    straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced 
                    diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become 
                    automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. 
                    Most of the safety procedures are intended to reduce the risk 
                    of drowning, and many of the rest are to reduce the risk of 
                    barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications 
                    getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to 
                    minimise the risk are followed.[6]

                    Cave-diving is underwater diving in water-filled caves. 
                    It may be done as an extreme sport, a way of exploring 
                    flooded caves for scientific investigation, or for the search 
                    for and recovery of divers or, as in the 2018 Thai cave rescue, 
                    other cave users. The equipment used varies depending on the 
                    circumstances, and ranges from breath hold to surface supplied, 
                    but almost all cave-diving is done using scuba equipment, often 
                    in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount 
                    or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave-diving is generally 
                    considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack 
                    of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often 
                    involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made 
                    by recreational diver training agencies between cave-diving 
                    and cavern-diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving 
                    in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be 
                    seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open 
                    water surface may also be specified.[1]

                    Scuba diving is obviously an incredible way for humans to 
                    observe and explore the underwater world. For ocean scientists, 
                    scuba diving is often essential to being able to observe and 
                    study the complex dynamics found beneath the surface. Using 
                    diving for science allows for a better understanding of the 
                    ocean, which ultimately helps us to better protect and conserve 
                    our blue planet. We’re ‘diving into ocean science’ with these 
                    three inspiring marine scientists that regularly use scuba 
                    diving for their research in all different parts of the world.

                    A faint but growing glimmer of light in the passage ahead signals 
                    the end of our dive. We exit a realm of eternal darkness into 
                    a circular basin of clear water. Above, the surface is as smooth 
                    and transparent as plate glass, and the pool’s surrounding tree 
                    line is clearly discernable. The transition from shadows into 
                    the illuminated pool borders on the surreal. This is why I never 
                    tire of Florida springs diving. And on that late Fall day, the 
                    entire basin was ours. I’m always amused when people stop diving 
                    Florida springs when the weather changes, because the water 
                    temperatures in these sparkling pools are always the same 
                    72-74 degrees F. It is this consistency and clarity that are 
                    the essence of diving Florida’s fountains of youth.
