                    Don't let his cuteness fool you! This little guy is as rambunctious
                as he looks. When he is not unleashing chaos onto the world, he will love and cuddle you just as hard.
                He enjoys cat nip way too much and bird watching all afternoon. He loves everyone he meets and is truly
                quite a character!
