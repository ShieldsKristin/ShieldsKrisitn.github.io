                <h1> Capybara</h1>
                <p>
                    The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) 
                    is a giant cavyrodent native to South America. It is the 
                    largest living rodent[2] and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. 
                    The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). 
                    Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and 
                    it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, 
                    and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, 
                    and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species 
                    and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but 
                    usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara 
                    is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its 
                    thick fatty skin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.

                <h4 id="Description">Desription</h4>
                <p>
                    The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short 
                    head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its 
                    body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat 
                    glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions 
                    of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.[7] The 
                    animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs 
                    little from over hair.[12]

                    Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in 
                    length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the withers, 
                    and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average 
                    in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9 kg (108 lb).[13][14][15] 
                    Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded 
                    weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 
                    73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay.[7][16] Also, 
                    an 81 kg individual was reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.[17] 
                    The dental formula is 1.0.1.31.0.1.3.[7] Capybaras have slightly 
                    webbed feet and vestigial tails.[7] Their hind legs are slightly 
                    longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear 
                    feet and four toes on their front feet.[18] Their muzzles are blunt, 
                    with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.

                <p>
                    Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic 
                    plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree bark.[15] They are 
                    very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one 
                    species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat 
                    a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer 
                    plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, 
                    they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26] 
                    Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional 
                    value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[25] 
                    The capybara’s jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew 
                    food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[27] 
                    Capybaras are autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their 
                    own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest 
                    the  cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, 
                    and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. 
                    They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to 
                    cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] As is the case with other rodents, 
                    the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate 
                    for the constant wear from eating grasses;[19] their cheek 
                    teeth also grow continuously.[27]

                    Capybaras are known to be gregarious. While they sometimes 
                    ive solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of 
                    around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four 
                    to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles.[33] 
                    Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals 
                    during the dry season[29][34] when the animals gather around 
                    available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, 
                    or general group consensus.[34] They can make dog-like barks[29] 
                    when threatened or when females are herding young.[35]

                    Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in 
                    the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely 
                    submerged for up to five minutes,[14] an ability they use to 
                    evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only 
                    their noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, 
                    they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon 
                    and early evening.[7] They also spend time wallowing in mud.[18] 
                    They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.[7]

                <h4 id="Popular">Popularity and meme culture</h4>
                <p>
                    In the early 2020s, capybaras became a growing figure of meme 
                    culture due to many factors, including the disturbances in 
                    Nordelta[54] which led to them being comically postulated as 
                    figures of class struggle. Also, a common meme format includes 
                    capybaras in various situations with the song “After Party” 
                    by Don Toliver,[56] leading to a tremendous growth in popularity.
                    [57] Due to a lyric in Toliver’s song, capybaras are also 
                    associated with the phrase “Ok I pull up”.[58]
